I</p> <p>Importantly, we hope to automate out manual data correction errors, and speed up the time between abstraction and report delivery.</p> <p>The work is divided into five phases, each one laying the foundation for the next and connecting directly to the process, data, automation, analytics, reporting, and KPI changes that follow.</p> <p>Phase 0 \u2013 Building the foundation: We began by cleaning and combining all existing CVD datasets to create one complete cumulative record from the registry\u2019s first year through to 2023. This work produced a single \u201csource of truth\u201d dataset and the first set of reusable Stata scripts, forming the base for later automation.</p> <p>Phase 1 \u2013 Understanding our system: Next, focussing on the post-REDCap phase, we examined active pre-Refit Stata algorithms. This audit told us what was working, what wasn\u2019t, and how we could standardise the process of signing off monthly datasets. The result was a clearer map of the current system and a new standard operating procedure for dataset release.</p> <p>Phase 2 \u2013 Automating our analytics: After these first foundational phases, we moved on to redesigning how the data are analysed. We created Stata programs that can run monthly and perform analyses with some level of automation. The automation removed the previous reliance on new algorithms for each analysis (primarily for bespoke data cleaning), hopefully improving the consistency and timliness of results.</p> <p>Phase 3 \u2013 Making the system accessible: To make sure staff can use the new tools without advanced coding skills, we built a set of easy-to-install BNR Stata commands. These provide \u201clow-code\u201d access to the automated analytics and reports, making the system more inclusive and sustainable over time.</p> <p>Phase 4 \u2013 Sharing knowledge: Finally, we developed training to help BNR staff use and maintain the new system confidently.

Here are the main data issues, and how we might sort through them, to deliver something useful for the project:</p> Issue Description Consequence 2023 Database revamp \u27a4 Poorly executed. \u27a4 System in development throughout - changes undocumented \u27a4 We know of some consequences. Perhaps not all... \u27a4 Certain key variables underwent change of meaning. We will create a mapping of key variables. No definitive historical CVD dataset \u27a4 The BNR historical record has never been organised, and seems in disarray. \u27a4 Process documentation and dataset documentation, if they exist, are lost in the unorganised folder structures. \u27a4 We have 'patched together' our best guess of the historical data record.\u27a4 To some extent, we are doing the same for process, but this goes beyond the project scope. Potentially unfixable missingness \u27a4 Unique IDs for a batch of the historical data record (20xx to 20xx) are missing \u27a4 We have created new IDs. \u27a4 But this affects (e.g.) repeat strokes. Within-REDCap data cleaning process seems minimal, or at best incomplete. \u27a4 within-REDCap data cleaning has - at least in part - broken down. \u27a4 Or perhaps within-REDCap data processing was never fully initiated by the BNR leads? \u27a4 This problem - over the years - has been patched by mixing post-REDCap data cleaning with analytics.\u27a4 This has created unmanageable analytical code that must be substantially altered for each analysis run. \u27a4 Code recycling (without implementing those important alterations) has likely led to analysis errors. Current automation will rely on dataset invariance \u27a4 In this work, we had planned to append new cases to the cumulative data record each month.\u27a4 Each new monthly addition must have the same structure as the cumulative record. \u27a4 Currently, data messyness within REDCap will be problematic.\u27a4 We have corrected the cumulative record to Dec 2023. Thereafter, without within-REDCap process improvements, errors will likely re-appear Death data not fit for purpose \u27a4 Not the fault of BNR \u27a4 Linkage with incidence data problematic - more positively, can be linked with uncertainty... <p>That's a few of the rather sobering findings from the project audit so far. The important question now, is what can we do, as part of this funded work, to make this work. We can do a lot I think. Here are some ideas, for discussion...</p> Idea Description Reduce level of planned automation \u27a4 We can improve project analytics a lot without full automation. A full set of analysis only <code>.do</code> files will be a huge improvement, without accompanying <code>.ado</code> files, menuing, or dialogue boxes. \u27a4 More automation at this point = more points of failure. 'Harden' BNR analytical outputs to data uncertainty \u27a4 Instead of automation work, we could explore the use of additional uncertainty work to recognise some of the BNR data limitations.\u27a4 For example, we might include sensitivity work to account for the uncertainty around defining underlying cause of death. Create a new category of research analytics \u27a4 For example, we might decide to shift the linkage of death records to incident cases to an 'occasional' research analysis - to remove the need for this time-consuming data preparation step. Create new monthly outputs for continuous reporting \u27a4 With monthly data exports - I'll assume these will be possible without errors at the point - we could create a new series of 'continuous output' results from the BNR - simple counts, smoothed incidence trends, charts compared to previous years. Use monthly outputs to carefully monitor performance KPIs \u27a4 These monthly reports could also be used to monitor BNR performance metrics. Reduce database variable size further \u27a4 The exported dataset still contains over 100 variables. Are they all needed? Could we still operate on a further reduced dataset, allied to simpler processing? Not sure myself, but worth a discussion? Quality might be compromised a little, but quality right now is already struggling, right? Simplify process wherever possible \u27a4 Linked to the above point, again worth a discussion to think through how we might do this? Brainstorm a radical revamp (for future perhaps?) \u27a4 My personal favourite :). I know not possible in the short-term, and perhaps not even likely in the long-term. \u27a4 We might like to imagine though, what a simple system might looks like that still produces incidence and mortality rates. With a lot less effort, it might produce results that are not too far from the truth...
