Purpose To outline the standardized process for - weekly cleaning, - monthly release of cumulative datasets for the cardiovascular (CVD) components of the BNR - Generation of tiered dataset versions based on data sensitivity. - Controlled access to datasets according to user roles and authorizations. 2. Scope This SOP applies to all personnel involved in BNR data processing, analysis, and dissemination related to cardiovascular diseases (acute myocardial infarction and stroke). 3. Definitions Full Dataset: Contains all identifiable and clinical information. De-identified Dataset: Direct identifiers removed; may contain dates and quasi-identifiers. Anonymized Dataset: Irreversibly stripped of identifiers and indirectly identifying information. Sign-off: Approval step confirming a dataset version is ready for release. 4. Responsibilities Role Responsibility QC Coordinator Weekly data cleaning, QC logging, anomaly flagging Data Abstractors Timely data entry and verification Statistician Versioning, dataset creation scripts, and documentation Technical Lead Final sign-off on dataset release Data Access Manager Access control oversight and authorization 5.1 Weekly Cleaning Timeline: Every Friday Tasks: - Run automated Stata QC checks on new records. - Log anomalies in QC tracker. - Update abstraction status (full/partial/unverified). - Flag high-risk or incomplete records for review. 5.2 Monthly Cumulative Dataset Release Timeline: 1st working day of each month Dataset Includes: -All fully abstracted and verified CVD cases from registry inception to end of the preceding month. Separate datasets for stroke and MI, plus merged version. Dataset Naming Convention: BNR-CVD_ .dta e.g., BNR-CVD_MI_DEID_202509.dta Release Folder Structure: /data/releases/YYYY/MM/ FULL/ DEID/ ANON/ 5.3 Tiered Dataset Creation and Small Island Privacy Considerations Given the BNR's context in Barbados, a small island developing state (SIDS) with a population of ~280,000, the risk of potential re-identification from seemingly benign combinations of data is higher than in larger jurisdictions. Even when direct identifiers are removed, indirect identifiers (\"quasi-identifiers\") may allow individuals to be re-identified when cross-referenced with external datasets or local knowledge. 5.3.1. Full Dataset All collected variables retained, including names, exact dates, hospital IDs. For internal BNR team only. 5.3.2. De-identified Dataset Includes: Removal of direct identifiers: Full names National IDs Addresses (home, work) Personal contact info Masking or modification of quasi-identifiers: Exact date of birth \u2192 replaced with year of birth or age at event Exact dates of admission/discharge \u2192 replaced with month and year Geographic data: parish may be retained; smaller location units (e.g. specific clinics or villages) redacted unless aggregate Occupation, rare conditions, or low-frequency diagnoses grouped or suppressed Ethnicity, nationality, or religion included only if not sensitive in local context and sample size is sufficient 5.3.3. Anonymized Dataset All identifying and quasi-identifying fields removed or generalized. Dates removed entirely (e.g. event year only or time since event). Age binned (e.g. 10-year age groups). Suppress all rare events (e.g. n < 5 for any combination of age, sex, condition). Categorical variables with unique or rare responses either: Aggregated (e.g., rare occupations grouped as \"Other\"), or Redacted 5.4 Analytical Review of Identifiability Risk To ensure appropriate anonymization: 5.4.1. Small Cell Count Suppression Run frequency tables for all combinations of age, sex, event type, and geography. Suppress cells with n < 5. 5.4.2. Re-identification Risk Analysis Perform k-anonymity or l-diversity checks across: Age \u00d7 Sex \u00d7 Parish Age \u00d7 Event type \u00d7 Admission month Age \u00d7 Outcome \u00d7 Length of stay If k < 5, aggregate or suppress variable combinations. 5.4.3. Human Oversight A designated Data Privacy Officer or equivalent will manually review output prior to dataset sign-off. Any concerns of potential identifiability are flagged and discussed with the Technical Lead prior to release. 6. Access Levels and Authorization Dataset Tier Typical Users Access Level Approval Required FULL Internal registry staff Read/Write Technical Lead DE-IDENTIFIED Approved researchers with IRB approval Read-only Technical Lead ANONYMIZED General public, policy makers Read-only None (Open Access) Request Process: - Access request form - MOH/IRB approvals - Review by Data Access Manager 7. Audit and Logs Maintain logs for: - Dataset creation and versioning (automated timestamps) - Sign-offs and access approvals - Dataset download activity 8. Data Integrity and Security All scripts and data securely stored and version controlled Monthly backups performed and archived Encrypted required for external transfers 9.
