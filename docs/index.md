# Welcome to the Barbados National Registry (BNR)

## About this Site

This site hosts documentation related to the 2025 BNR “refit” project — an initiative to improve the efficiency, automation, and therefore hopefully the sustainability of the BNR data systems.

## The Barbados National Registry
The **Barbados National Registry for Chronic Non-Communicable Disease (BNR)** is a national surveillance system operated by the George Alleyne Chronic Disease Research Centre (GA-CDRC) on behalf of the Barbados Ministry of Health and Wellness. Since its establishment in 2008–2010, the BNR has been a unique and pioneering initiative—one of the first multi-NCD registries in the Western Hemisphere. It consists of three core components:

- **BNR-Stroke** – launched in 2008  
- **BNR-Heart** – launched in 2009  
- **BNR-Cancer** – launched in 2010  

The BNR collects national data on incident cases of stroke, heart attack (acute myocardial infarction), and cancer. These data inform health system performance, clinical care improvements, public health policies, and research across the Caribbean.

### BNR Impact and Recognition

The BNR has:
- Provided high-quality national incidence and mortality estimates
- Supported academic outputs and continuing medical education
- Served as a model surveillance system for other small island states
