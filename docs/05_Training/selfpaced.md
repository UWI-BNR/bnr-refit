# Asynchronous, Self-Paced Learning
This page describes the asynchronous, self-paced training course developed for BNR team members and collaborators. The course is designed for flexible learning and includes a structured set of materials: a detailed user guide, step-by-step tutorials as needed, guided practice exercises using sample datasets, and interactive walkthroughs of the Stata menu and no-code interface. Learners can proceed at their own pace, revisit materials as needed, and access ongoing support through embedded tooltips and documentation links. This approach reduces the need for repeated in-person training while ensuring long-term sustainability and onboarding efficiency.
