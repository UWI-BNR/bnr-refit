# Data Sharing Agreement
This page will outline the BNR's evolving approach to secure, ethical, and transparent data sharing with third-party users. Two core mechanisms are being developed: (1) Data Sharing Agreements (DSAs) and (2) Data Trusts.

DSAs are formal contracts between BNR and specific data users—such as researchers, ministries, or partners—which define the purpose, scope, duration, and conditions of use for a specific data request. These agreements ensure compliance with local regulations, institutional review protocols, and protect individual confidentiality.

Data Trusts, by contrast, are more structural governance frameworks that enable long-term, repeatable access to approved datasets under the stewardship of a trusted intermediary or board. Data trusts provide an additional layer of accountability and are designed for ongoing partnerships or repeated use cases where transparency, community oversight, and sustainability are key.

This page will document BNR’s commitment to data sovereignty, explain our approval and review process, and provide draft templates and FAQs to guide prospective data users. Our goal is to facilitate responsible data use that maximises impact while maintaining public trust.
