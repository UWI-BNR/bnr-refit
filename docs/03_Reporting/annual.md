# Annual report
This page will detail the analysis and reporting process for the BNR Annual Cardiovascular Disease Report. It will describe the full end-to-end process: data extraction, transformation, indicator calculation, quality assurance, and final automated PDF generation within Stata. It will also highlight performance benchmarking and how the report feeds into national planning and regional comparisons.
