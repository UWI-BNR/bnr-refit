# Data Changes

**Notes:**  

1. These data-focused changes aim to improve clarity, consistency, and accountability of the BNR analytics and reporting.  

2. Together, they provide the structure needed for automation, reproducible analysis, and transparent sharing of high-quality, standardised datasets.

| CHANGE MADE | RATIONALE | HOW WILL WE HELP | RESOURCE |
|--------------|---------|------------------| |
| **Define and describe data sources** | ➤ To clearly identify all data inputs—who they come from, what they contain, and how they are transferred.<br>➤ Shift towards full BNR data provenance. | ⓘ Advise |🟨<br>[See Data Sources](../../02_Data/sources.md)|
| **Data structure** | ➤ To create a standardised data dictionary and metadata framework that define variable names, formats, and coding conventions.<br>➤ Important for analytics and for longer-term data curation. | 🗹 Lead |❌<br>[See data dictionary](../../02_Data/structure.md)|
| **Dataset sign-off** | ➤ To formalise the approval process for monthly exported datasets, confirming completeness and accuracy before downstream use. | 🗹 Lead |🟨<br>[See dataset release process (Step 6)](../../02_Data/dataset-release.md)|
| **Dataset storage** | ➤ To document potential secure storage methods and locations for identifiable, de-identified, and anonymised/aggregated datasets, aligning with data protection standards. | ⚙ Contribute |❌<br>[See dataset storage advise](../../02_Data/storage.md)|
| **Dataset release** | ➤ To establish a standard operating procedure (SOP) for controlled dataset release, ensuring consistency and auditability. | 🗹 Lead |🟨<br>[See dataset release SOP](../../02_Data/dataset-release.md)|
| **Dataset dissemination** | ➤ To create a SOP that guides how datasets are shared internally and externally, balancing transparency with confidentiality. | 🗹 Lead |🟨<br>[See dataset dissemination SOP](../../02_Data/dataset-dissemination.md)|
| **Data sharing** | ➤ To define the SOP governing all data sharing activities, clarifying roles, permissions, and approval pathways. | 🗹 Lead |❌<br>[See dataset sharing SOP](../../02_Data/sharing/index.md)|
| **Data Sharing / Data Trust Agreements** | ➤ To formalise agreements that specify how data can be shared, used, and governed — strengthening trust and legal compliance. | 🗹 Lead |➤ ❌[Agreement](../../02_Data/sharing/dsa.md)<br>➤ ❌[Trust](../../02_Data/sharing/dsa.md)|
| **Death data** | ➤ To reimagine how the registry uses incomplete or poor-quality national death data, integrating it in ways that still add value without compromising accuracy. | 🗹 Lead |🟨<br>[See statistical analysis plan](../../03_Reporting/sap.md)|
