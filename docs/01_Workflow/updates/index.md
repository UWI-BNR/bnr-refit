# Summarising the Refit changes

The BNR Refit Project is our step-by-step plan to modernise how we handle, analyse, and report national cardiovascular disease (CVD) data. It builds on more than a decade of registry experience and turns what was once a heavily manual process into one that is cleaner, faster, and so hopefully easier to maintain. I

!!! success "Importantly, we hope to *automate out* manual data correction errors, and speed up the time between abstraction and report delivery."
    
 The work is divided into five phases, each one laying the foundation for the next and connecting directly to the process, data, automation, analytics, reporting, and KPI changes that follow.

**Phase 0 – Building the foundation:**  
We began by cleaning and combining all existing CVD datasets to create one complete cumulative record from the registry’s first year through to 2023. This work produced a single “source of truth” dataset and the first set of reusable Stata scripts, forming the base for later automation.

**Phase 1 – Understanding our system:**  
Next, focussing on the post-REDCap phase, we examined active *pre-Refit* Stata algorithms. This audit told us what was working, what wasn’t, and how we could standardise the process of signing off monthly datasets. The result was a clearer map of the current system and a new standard operating procedure for dataset release.

**Phase 2 – Automating our analytics:**  
After these first foundational phases, we moved on to redesigning how the data are analysed. We created Stata programs that can run monthly and perform analyses with some level of automation. The automation removed the previous reliance on new algorithms for each analysis (primarily for bespoke data cleaning), hopefully improving the consistency and timliness of results.

**Phase 3 – Making the system accessible:**  
To make sure staff can use the new tools without advanced coding skills, we built a set of easy-to-install BNR Stata commands. These provide “low-code” access to the automated analytics and reports, making the system more inclusive and sustainable over time.

**Phase 4 – Sharing knowledge:**  
Finally, we developed training to help BNR staff use and maintain the new system confidently. This is provided by an online self-paced learning site, ensuring that the knowledge behind the system is shared and embedded for the future.

Together, these phases mark a shift from a person-dependent system to a process-driven one—where clean data, clear documentation, and simple automation keep the registry stronger for the longer term.
