# Reporting Changes

**Notes:**  

1. These reporting changes ensure that the outputs from the automated analytics are clear, consistent, and ready for publication or internal use.  
2. Together, they form the link between the BNR’s analytics system and the evidence used by policymakers, clinicians, and the public.
