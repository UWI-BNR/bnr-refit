# BNR Process Overview

Welcome to the **BNR Process** section. Here we explain how the Barbados National Registry (BNR) operates — how data are collected, managed, and reported — and how these processes are now evolving.

This section is designed for anyone who works with or supports the registry. By the end, you’ll understand **how the BNR works today** and **what’s changing** as we move towards analysis and reporting automation.

---

## Why we’re documenting these processes

Good data depends on good processes. By clearly describing what we do and how we do it, we make it easier for everyone to:

- follow consistent steps,
- see how their work connects to other team members, and  
- suggest improvements with confidence.

This documentation supports BNR training — helping new team members learn how the BNR operates and why certain steps matter.

## What you’ll find in this section

### A. How the BNR operated before this Refit – the “as-is” process

These pages describe how the BNR functioned prior to this refit.

We explain:

- how data flow through each stage,  
- who is responsible for what, and  
- common challenges or delays.

For background → [BNR Data Handling Infrastructure](./bnr-infrastructure.md)

The BNR "As-Is" Process → [BNR Process](./bnr-process.md)  

Our Audit of the BNR "As-Is" Process → [BNR Process Audit](./bnr-process-audit.md)

### B. How we’re improving – the “new process”

We are updating several parts of our system to make our work more consistent, transparent, and effective. Each topic below explains what’s changing, why, and what difference it will make.

- [Process updates](./updates/process-new.md) — how we redefine data procedures.   
- [Dataset updates](./updates/dataset-new.md) — how we simplify variables and improve definitions.  
- [Analytics updates](./updates/analytics-new.md) — how we produce cleaner, faster, and more reliable results.  
- [Reporting updates](./updates/reporting-new.md) — how we share information more clearly and regularly.  

See all → [Updates index](./updates/index.md)

## How to use this section

This section is meant to be interactive and self-paced. You can read it straight through, or dip into the parts that relate to your work or interest.

Each page includes:

- a short overview of what the topic covers,  
- a description of our current approach and planned improvements, and  
- practical examples or checklists you can use in your own work.

---

Our suggestion is that BNR process is reviewed annually.
