# Introduction to the BNR Refit Project

The **BNR Refit Project** (2025–2026) is a one-off project designed to revamp and automate the analytics and reporting infrastructure of the cardiovascular component of the Barbados National Registry. Funded by the Barbados Ministry of Health and Wellness, the project is a response to reduced funding and staffing, growing data demands, and the need for long-term sustainability.

## Background

Since 2009, the BNR has operated using custom-built processes for collecting, curating, and reporting national cardiovascular disease data. These processes, developed using a range of changing systems over the years, and currently (as of July 2025) dependent on REDCap (for databasing) and Stata (for data analysis), have grown complex and are heavily dependent on specialised personnel. The current refit aims to:

- Improve efficiency through system automation
- Enable no-code access to most data analytics and reporting
- Standardise data outputs and reporting formats
- Build internal capacity through training and documentation

## Project Scope

The project is organised into four main phases, each with clearly defined deliverables:

| Phase | Activity | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **1** | **Analytics System Assessment**<br>• Audit existing Stata algorithms<br>• Develop monthly dataset sign-off process | • Algorithm audit report<br>• New Stata scripts<br>• SOP for dataset release |
| **2** | **Analytics Enhancement**<br>• Automate monthly, quarterly, annual analytics<br>• Automate reporting output | • Fully automated Stata algorithms<br>• Report auto-generation scripts |
| **3** | **Overlay Code-Free Access**<br>• Build Stata menu system for no-code access<br>• Install on BNR machines | • Stata menu interface<br>• SOP for installation and access |
| **4** | **System Training**<br>• Conduct staff training<br>• Develop online training resources | • 1-day virtual training<br>• Online operations manual |

## Key Details

- **Duration**: Jan 2025 – Mar 2026  
- **Software**: Stata (analytics), mkdocs (web development) 
- **Client**: Barbados National Registry (BNR) / The University of the West Indies  
- **Technical Lead**: Dr Christina Howitt

## Guiding Principles

- Preserve analytic rigour  
- Reduce reliance on specialist Stata coding  
- Increase timeliness, transparency, reproducibility of outputs  
- Build a replicable model for potential use across the Caribbean
