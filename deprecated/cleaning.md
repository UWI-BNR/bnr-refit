# Data Cleaning.
This section will outline the procedures used to clean abstracted data, focusing on real-time validation and query resolution within REDCap. It will describe how built-in edit checks and branching logic help prevent data entry errors, and how outstanding queries are tracked and resolved by the team. Planned improvements to streamline cleaning through automation and better user interfaces will also be covered.
